# Metabolomics and Analytics Centre

The ambition of the Metabolomics and Analytics Centre led by Thomas Hankemeier is to develop innovative analytical strategies for metabolomics-driven health monitoring and systems biology studies. Understanding the intricate balance between health, disease and adaptation to challenges relies on the identification of systematic changes during time. The ability to stratify risk and predict disease will enable us to tailor therapies and improve prognosis as envisioned in personalized medicine. We believe that continuous health monitoring and personalized medicine approaches can be achieved with large-cohort studies involving multiple patient samples, or in-vitro/ex-vivo samples such as stem cell derived in-vitro models. We are convinced that personalized health care can be possible only with cross-disciplinary efforts and translational collaboration, as well as standardized procedures and revolutionary analytical approaches.
